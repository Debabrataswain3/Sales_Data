# 🛍️ Sales_Data Analysis (MySQL + Python in Jupyter Notebook)

### 📘 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes a small **Sales Dataset** using **MySQL** for data storage and queries, and **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** in **Jupyter Notebook** for data visualization and insights.
The goal is to extract key business metrics such as **total quantity sold**, **total revenue**, and **performance by product**.

---

### 🎯 **Project Objective**

* To connect a MySQL database (`sales_db`) with Python.
* To perform SQL queries for analyzing product-wise sales data.
* To visualize revenue and quantity sold using simple bar charts.
* To summarize business insights and improve decision-making through data.

### 🧩 **Dataset Used**

A small sample sales dataset containing:

| Column     | Description          |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| `id`       | Unique identifier    |
| `product`  | Product name         |
| `quantity` | Number of units sold |
| `price`    | Price per unit       |

📂 **Dataset File:** [`sales_data.sql`](https://github.com/Debabrataswain3/Sales_Data/blob/main/sales_db.sql)

> You can import this `.sql` file into MySQL directly using Workbench or the MySQL CLI.

---

### ❓ **Business Questions / KPIs**

1. What is the **total quantity sold** for each product?
2. What is the **total revenue** generated by each product?
3. Which products are the **top revenue generators**?
4. How do **quantity sold** and **revenue** compare across products?

---

### ⚙️ **Process Workflow**

1. **Database Creation:**

   * Created a MySQL database `sales_db`.
   * Imported `sales_data.sql` containing a single table `sales`.

2. **Data Extraction using Python:**

   * Connected to MySQL using `SQLAlchemy` and `PyMySQL`.
   * Used Pandas `read_sql_query()` to execute SQL queries.

3. **Data Visualization:**

   * Used `matplotlib` to plot **bar charts** showing revenue by product.

4. **Insight Generation:**

   * Compared quantity and revenue trends to identify high-performing products.

### 💡 **Key Insights**

* Products like **Laptops** and **Mobiles** generate the highest revenue.
* Although **Headphones** have a higher sales quantity, their low price results in lower revenue.
* **Smartwatches** and **Tablets** show moderate performance, with potential for growth through marketing or bundle offers.

---

### 🧠 **Final Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how **SQL and Python** can be effectively combined for quick business analysis:

* MySQL handles structured storage and querying.
* Python (Pandas + Matplotlib) enables seamless data analysis and visualization.
* The process provides a repeatable, scalable framework for small-scale sales analytics that can later integrate with larger BI tools like Power BI or Tableau.
